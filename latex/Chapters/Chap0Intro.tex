\section{Main Section 1}

Finding inverse transformations is an active area of research..
Many successful attempts with neural networks have been made..

This work explores how an already trained neural network can be used for this task.
Inspired by DeepInversion..
Explores further possibilities and additional formulations.. adapts to task of 
neural network adjustment for out of distribution data..


Outline:
Chap 1 introduces some basic notation used throughout
// put nn intro in chap 1? Swap 1 and 2?
Chap 2 explains the objective/goal of this work and states the formally states the problem.
Chap 3 introduces the experiments that were done, various methods, reconstruction perturbation
models, data sets, evaluation
