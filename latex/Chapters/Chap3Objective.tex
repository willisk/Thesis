\subsection{Objective Outline}
This section introduces the main objective of this work. An outline is given in \cref{fig:outline}.

Suppose we are given a target data set $\set B$ 
and a neural network that was trained on - or performs reasonably well on - a source data set $\set A$.
% The neural network is able to predict data coming from $\set A$ accurately, 
Further,
the distribution of $\set B$ differs crucially from $\set A$, 
i.e. such that the neural network is unable to reach high performance 
on data coming from $\set B$.
The task is to learn a transformation $\rho$ that adjusts $\set B$ 
so that the network's performance is regained.

An underlying assumption is that $\set B$ originates from the same distribution
as $\set A$, but has been corrupted by an unknown perturbation $\delta$.
The transformation $\rho$ is modeled to correct for this perturbation, 
in the sense that $\rho(\set B) \approx \set B_\text{true}$.
This is done by minimizing a dissimilarity-score between $\set B$ and $\set A$ 
in a feature space given by an appropriate feature-map $\varphi$, 
after the transformation $\rho$ has been applied to $\set B$.
For this, simple statistics of both data sets, such as the mean and variance 
are recorded in feature space and $\rho$ is optimized by backpropagation 
in order to make the statistics of the target $\set B$ approach those of the source $\set A$.
%
Whether matching statistics in feature space actually increases similarity between $\set A$ and $\set B$
strongly depends on $\varphi$ and its representation of the data set.
%
One hope is that the found transformation $\rho$ will be close to an inverse transformation
of $\delta$, i.e. that $\rho\circ\delta \approx \text{id}$, the identity transformation,
although it is important to note that this is a much stronger requirement than 
saying that $\rho(\set B) \approx \set B_\text{true}$, that the data set is reconstructed fairly well.


\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given a feature-mapping $\varphi$, a data set $\set B$ and a data set $\set A$ - or simply the statistics of $\varphi(\set A)$,  find $\rho \in \mathcal{F}$, such that
\[
     \loss _\varphi (\set A, \rho(\set B)) \,,
\]
is minimized.
Here, the solution space $\mathcal F$ is a pre-defined set of functions, 
parametrized by a vector $\boldsymbol \theta$.

A secondary part of this work concerns what kind of data 
may be recovered from having access to the feature-space-statistics of a data set.
In this setting, we are given the source statistics of data set $\set A$
and, in contrast to the previous task, modify the target $\set B$ directly to 
minimize the dissimilarity just as outlined in \cref{sec:Reconstruction}.
The target data set is initialized randomly and then is 
iteratively refined by backpropagation through the loss function 
after being mapped to feature-space.



\subsection{Problem Statement}
Given a feature-mapping $\varphi$, the statistics of $\varphi(\set A)$
and target labels $\{y^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{n_{\set B}}$ for a fixed integer size $n_{\set B}$,
find $\set B$, such that
\[
     \loss _\varphi (\set A, \set B)
\]
is minimized and where $\set B = \{(\vec x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\}_{i=1}^{n_{\set B}}$.

    


% \subsection{Problem Formulation}
% The result of the optimization process can be evaluated by calculating the accuracy obtained by $\Phi$. 
% Though, since $\Phi$ was used in the optimization process, it will likely display heavy bias to what it believes is a correctly classified sample.
% For this sake, another neural network $\Phi_{\text{ver}}$ can be employed, which has been separately trained on either $\set A$ or another data set. 

%Though, practice has shown that a very small portion of $\set A$ is only needed to obtain a close-enough guess at the true statistics of $\set A$.
